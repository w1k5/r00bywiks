The internet has indulged every single one of our hedonist whims, and I think I was shaped by it, completely and fully. From stupid flash games flooded with malware, to the sweet, loving embrace of unsettingly invasive advertising, the web has changed through the years, shaping the kids who were born with it. Nothing you look at nowadays is private. I'm just here to hang out, though. The experience of being a person varies so aggressivelyâ€” I just wanna to use the internet for one of its more innocent purposes: to learn about one another and to gradually accept and understand the common truths between our lives.

Thanks for reading.
