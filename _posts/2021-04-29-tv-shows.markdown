I binge television shows a lot. I mean, I enjoy the noise in the background, and it's like my attraction to video games, just without the interactivity. It's easier.<br><br>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IZombie_(TV_series)" target="_blank" style="font-family: gentle; display: initial;">iZombie</a> The description of this show as provided by Google makes me laugh⁠— "When over-achieving medical resident Liv Moore attends a party that turns into a zombie feeding frenzy, she ends up joining the ranks of the living dead. Determined to pass as human despite her pale appearance and newly listless demeanor, Liv forms a plan to resist her drive to consume fresh human brains by taking a job at a coroner's office, where she can secretly snack on the brains of corpses delivered there. Soon discovering that she absorbs the memories of those she feeds on, she finds new purpose by posing as a psychic and working with a detective to help solve their murders."— isn't that just a LOT? It's really funny and dark though and often wanders into the absurd. I think I like it because Liv Moore is depressed and looks for meaning through others: even when all feels hopeless, there is something to learn from everybody and there is always hope to be found.

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother" target="_blank" style="font-family: gentle; display: initial;">How I Met Your Mother</a> Big 2000s vibes. I really liked watching this when I was probably too young to be watching it. And I find something so wholesome about Ted's dedication to love, even though he acts like a bag of dicks sometimes. It makes me want to be a bit less cynical. Also, I really like that it's set in a New York that's aggressively New York, especially considering that I'm still in college, living with my parents, and during quarantine. I like that I get to watch these happy people with their ordinary friends and their ordinary friendships. I know sitcoms with canned laughter have fallen out of popularity now, but there's something so easy about it.

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(TV_series)" target="_blank" style="font-family: gentle; display: initial;">Bones</a> I really like the main female lead in this. She's smart and beautiful and socially awkward: it resonates with me deeply. She deals with gore and death in order to help her sexy FBI parter, Seeley Booth, solve crimes, and the will-they, won't-they drama keeps me eternally on edge.
<br><p style="font-family: gentle; display: initial;">Pros</p><ul><li>Smart, attractive, awkward female lead</li><li>Crime</li><li>Dark humor</li></ul><p style="font-family: gentle; display: initial;">Cons</p><ul><li>Lots of gory imagery</li><li>I've seen it <i>way</i> too many times</li></ul>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City" target="_blank" style="font-family: gentle; display: initial;">Sex and the City</a> Four fabulous women living in 90s New York City, dating a variety of handsome (and not so handsome) men, talking audaciously and endlessly about their sex lives! A historical artifact of its times.

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_(TV_series)" target="_blank" style="font-family: gentle; display: initial;">Castle</a> Rick Castle is a writer following around a sexy redheaded cop. Castle's funny and charming and makes even murder seem fun! It's eccentric, and like the other shows on this list, filled with dark humor.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_Adventures_of_Sabrina_(TV_series)" target="_blank" style="font-family: gentle; display: initial;">Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</a> I'd like to think this is the only truly trashy TV show on this list meant for "Young Adults," or whatever that means. I mean, it's last for a reason: I <i>know</i> it's a Riverdale-tier show, and it's certainly a guilty pleasure, but damn, a girl needs her eye candy! I mean, I also like all the Biblical references in it, even though it is a bit sacrilegious... but also, mmm, eye candy and cheap romance...</li><br><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Zk9mW5OmXTz9e/giphy.gif" style="max-width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
