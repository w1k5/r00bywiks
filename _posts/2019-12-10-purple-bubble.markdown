Weâ€™re in the Purple Bubble. Typically, the mountains encompass us, nature providing us with a clear horizon and edge to our world. When it snows or when it rains, the clouds and fog obscure the mountains and only the campus buildings remain in our vision of reality. There is nothing but the human-made structures before us: bounce between the administrative buildings, dorms, and academic ones.
