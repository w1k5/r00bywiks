You close your eyes:<br>
A momentary peace.<br>
Everything fits together all too perfectly<br>
and your heart is finally cooling.<br>
After simmering for so long,<br>
steam finally begins to slowly<br>
drift<br>
away<br>
from your sore soul.

But of course,<br>
Why would it last?<br>
Why would you let yourself feel such serenity?<br>
Why not let the kettle fall,<br>
splashing hot water<br>
all over the tiled floor?<br>
It falls.

The approaching stillness<br>
scared you. Vulnerability<br>
(or rather, a fear of it)<br>
moved you.<br>
You gave in momentarily<br> 
and need a moment to recover,<br>
alone.
