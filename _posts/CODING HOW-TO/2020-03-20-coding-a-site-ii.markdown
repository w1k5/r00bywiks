Now that we've created a website for you to play around with in terms of coding, the world is your oyster! Well, it always was from the start, but now you have the opportunity to learn so much! I've always though a website is like a home... you step inside, and immediately you make judgements, whether conscious or subconscious. All the pretty stuff you see on a website, from the setup to the colors to the sizes of text, is all done in CSS, or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets</a>. All the text and text formatting (bold, italics, underline, etc.) is done in HTML. HTML also provides the structure for the website, specifically in the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; tags. Now, let's get messy, baby...<!-- more -->

Alright, so if you edit the text in the &lt;p&gt; or &lt;h1&gt;, you can by just replacing the "Hello World" or "I'm hosted with Github Pages." because who would want to read that, right? Once you're ready, let's spruce it up a lil bit.

<ol><li>Make a CSS sheet to hold all of the decor for your site by making a new file using your text error in your given repository.</li>
<li>Consider that &lt;p&gt; or &lt;h1&gt; are both pieces of texts, &lt;p&gt; being a basic paragraph text and &lt;h1&gt; being a header. To make them less bland than the pre-set black Arial or Times New Roman font, you can attribute specific characteristics to each type using your Cascading Style Sheet! Try this:

<pre><code>p {font: italic bold 12px/30px Georgia, serif;}
</code></pre></li>
